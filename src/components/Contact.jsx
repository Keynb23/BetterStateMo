// contact page is okay, but it's dull. goes with the color scheme, but it should contrast more.

// should show business contact information on the left hand side, then on the right side have the customer input contact information , with a devider in the middle.


const Contact = () => {
  return (
    <div>Contact</div>
  )
}

export default Contact
