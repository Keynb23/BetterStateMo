// quote request should be in the navbar, but should also be a button.

// fix, create a "Click for Quote" btn. pass to navbar, hero deals, each service card will have one, and about section. 

// could also make this a sticky pop up, but this might get ignored by people just getting used to it being on the page, they can't see it. It sounds dumb, but it happens.
