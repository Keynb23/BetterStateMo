TO DO: 

crop the hero video so it loops better

these pages/components need styled:

page doesn't automatically take you to the top of the page if you click a link to a new page if you're at the bottom of the page. 

spacing and text in hero was messed up somehow.



phone view for some sections need work (Hero, meetus, and gallery, profile page)

profile page spacing is off for phone.

gallery sometimes redirects you randomly when clicking on it. not exactly sure


create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
