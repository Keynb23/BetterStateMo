TO DO: 

crop the hero video so it loops better

these pages/components need styled:

profile page, appoint page, appointment and gallery

profile page's vertical spacing is messed up. 

appointment page's colors are messed up.

gallery grid is squished together. might just switch it to flex or reinstall masonry 




create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
