HERO 
make the hero a pool, instead of the whole page
this would look better and not have as many
or any issues with loading

just some ripple effect, who we are, what we do
and why you should choose us

the slogan can go there too



TO DO: 
git add

HERO NEEDS ADDED!!!!!!

slogan not centered. NEEDS MOVED

TOO WHITE 

random line on top of first service card

create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
