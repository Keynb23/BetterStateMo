TO DO: 

add tests with jest

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page


create a profile page

create a login/register component with a log out button.

once you set an apt, a profile will automatically be generated for you, then you will be prompted to set a password. you can decline this option and your profile will be deleted or not created at all.
// simple profile page. just a page for customer to check for updates on the job they order
// easily put in a service request without having to go through the whole process. 


ideas:

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
