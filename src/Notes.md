TO DO: 

crop the hero video so it loops better

these pages/components need styled:

gallery

gallery grid is squished together. might just switch it to flex or reinstall masonry 



phone view for some sections need work (Hero, sevices, about)


create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
