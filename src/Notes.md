TO DO: 

create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page

ideas:

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
