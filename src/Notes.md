TO DO:

these pages/components need styled:

======================================
NEED TO CREATE NEW TEST FOR SERVICE CONTEXT

==========================================

 profile pages need style updated and media queries for profile page.

 ===============

 scroll feature is being weird still on mobile

 ================== 

 add a gallery popup button to the hero or just add a gallery button to the hero
==============================

update the cjs files to ESM
=====================================

ANDREW'S NOTES: UPDATE THE PICTURES IN SERVICE CARDS, UPDATES SERVICE CARDS "SERVICES" DESCRIPTION SO THAT IT'S CLEARN THAT SERVICES COVER MAINTENECE, SERCICE, CLEANING, ECT..

OPENING AND CLOSINGS TAKE A COUPLE VISITS

WEEKLY POOL SERVICING OPTIONS OR JUST WEEKLY. DOUBLE CHECK

for footer product, check with andrew for the correct products. they doin't use Sanitify


---===================

Double check all the colors for text. Review card text should be primary instead of secondary. Failed to login on profile dropdwon is secondary. Should be danger. Will have to use !important for both.

===================================
create Blaze account with card info (business card)

add tests with jest
=============================================

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers
===========================================
ideas:

In the future, create an app for them
====================================
Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service)
===================================================
Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs. (Andrew liked this idea)
==============================
