TO DO: 

crop the hero video so it loops better

these pages/components need styled:


phone view for some sections need work (Hero, meetus, and gallery, profile page)

profile page doesn't redirect to the top when clicking it and it's spacing is off for phone.

contact background should be less intense blue and fade into the white color for the objection blockers

gallery sometimes redirects you randomly when clicking on it. not exactly sure


create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Testimonial page

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs.
