TO DO: 

crop the hero video so it loops better

these pages/components need styled:

spacing and text in hero was messed up somehow.


phone view for some sections need work (Hero, meetus, and gallery, profile page)

profile page spacing is off for phone.

gallery sometimes redirects you randomly when clicking on it. not exactly sure




ANDREW'S NOTES: UPDATE THE PICTURES IN SERVICE CARDS, UPDATES SERVICE CARDS "SERVICES" DESCRIPTION SO THAT IT'S CLEARN THAT SERVICES COVER MAINTENECE, SERCICE, CLEANING, ECT..

OPENING AND CLOSINGS TAKE A COUPLE VISITS 

WEEKLY POOL SERVICING OPTIONS OR JUST WEEKLY. DOUBLE CHECK

CAPS LOCKS ON LOL

-----------------

Double check all the colors for text. Review card text should be primary instead of secondary.  Failed to login on profile dropdwon is secondary. Should be danger. Will have to use !important for both.








create Blaze account with card info (business card) 

add tests with jest

NEEDS:

Picture of both Andrew and Josh in their work shirts to create trust with customers

ideas:

In the future, create an app for them 

Chat bot that can set apts, leave a message to be contacted, Requrest quote(request to be contacted, but it send a message to business saying they would like a quote on this service) 

Maybe a donate page for a the VA hospital or something. Further lean into the Vet owned thing. Plus I think there are tax write offs. (Andrew liked this idea)














GOOGLE GEMINI SUGGESTIONS:
FOOTER NOTES:
Shrink and Reposition the "Stairs" Blocks:

Reduce Width: Instead of full-width, significantly reduce the width of each dark blue "step." They could be perhaps 30-50% of the screen width, or even narrower if containing just logos or short links.

Align to One Side: Position these smaller steps consistently to either the left or right side of the footer area. This creates a more distinct "staircase" visual rather than just stacked full-width bars.

Stack Vertically with Offset: Arrange them vertically, slightly offset from each other horizontally, to truly create the visual of descending (or ascending) steps. This will make the "stairs" feel more deliberate.

============

Clarify Content for Each "Step":

"Our Partners / Brands We Use" (Top Step): This is an excellent use of space. Replace the placeholder text with actual logos (ensure you have permission to use them) or small, clear text links to partner sites. You could add a small heading like "Our Trusted Partners" above this specific step.

"Visit Our Old Site / Corporate Site" (Middle Step): Clearly label this link. For example, "Visit Our Previous Site" or "Better State Corp. Site."

"Site by A KeynB Production" (Bottom Step): This is clear. Ensure the LinkedIn icon is clickable and leads to your profile/company page.

=======

Enhance the "Stairs" Visual (Subtly):

Subtle Overlap: If stacking, you could make them slightly overlap each other using CSS margin-top with negative values or z-index to reinforce the stepping effect.

Small Gap/Line: A thin, light line or a small gap between the "steps" could further define each one.

Consider a Pool-Themed Texture: For the main light blue footer section, you could subtly incorporate a very faint texture that mimics water ripples, pool tiles, or a subtle gradient that fades like pool depth. This would reinforce the "pool" aspect of your stairs concept.

==========

Review Overall Footer Cohesion:

Spacing: Ensure adequate padding and margins so the content within the main blue bar and the "stairs" blocks don't feel cramped.

Visual Hierarchy: The main contact/hours info is important; ensure it remains prominent in the light blue section. The "stairs" content should be secondary but clearly visible.

HERO NOTES:

Introduce a Primary, Engaging Headline (H1):

Note: While "BETTER STATE LLC" is your company name, and your tagline is great, the hero section currently lacks a distinct, large headline that immediately hooks the visitor and conveys a key benefit or welcome.

Suggestion: Add a prominent <h1> headline, likely positioned above "BETTER STATE LLC." This headline should be the largest text on the page and quickly tell visitors what you offer or how you benefit them.

Examples:

"Transforming Outdoor Living Spaces"

"Your Dream Oasis Starts Here"

"Experience Unmatched Quality in Pool & Landscape Care"

Why: This creates a stronger visual hierarchy and immediately communicates your core value proposition, drawing users in.

Refine the Text Block's Visual Presentation (Add Structure):

Note: Even with the dark overlay, the text elements ("BETTER STATE LLC," tagline, "Explore Our Services" button) currently appear to float directly on the video.

Suggestion: Consider placing these core text elements within a subtle, slightly transparent content box or "card" that is centered over your video overlay. This box could have a very faint background (e.g., a very light grey or white with low opacity) or just be defined by consistent padding and alignment.

Why: This gives your main message a more defined and intentional visual presence, making it feel more integrated into the design and less like text simply dropped onto the video. It adds a layer of sophistication.

Enhance CTA Interactivity ("Explore Our Services"):

Note: The button is well-placed and visible.

Suggestion: Ensure the button has a clear and engaging hover effect (e.g., a subtle background color change, a slight increase in size, or a shadow). You could also add a very subtle entrance animation (like a gentle fade-in or slide-up) when the page loads to draw the eye to it.

Why: Visual feedback and subtle animations make the button feel more dynamic, professional, and inviting to click.

Clarify the "Request a Quote" Floating Button:

Note: The button in the bottom-right corner is for "Request a Quote" and has a ' 
′
 icon.Whilefunctional,the 
′
 ' icon alone might not be immediately universally understood as "request a quote."

Suggestion:

Add a Text Label: Consider including a small text label next to the '$' icon, such as "Quote" or "Get a Quote," to remove any ambiguity.

Tooltip: Alternatively, ensure a clear tooltip appears when the user hovers over the button, explicitly stating its purpose.

Why: Clearer labeling ensures all users understand the button's function instantly, leading to a better user experience and potentially more conversions.

Review Video Content for Optimal Background Use:

Note: While the overlay helps, the video itself plays a huge role in the overall feel.

Suggestion: Ensure your background video loop is smooth, relatively calm (avoiding overly quick cuts or chaotic scenes), and visually appealing. Videos with slow-motion, scenic shots, or focused details (like water shimmering, a person casually enjoying a pool) generally work best as backgrounds as they enhance atmosphere without distracting from the overlaid content.

Why: A well-chosen and executed video background adds a premium feel and reinforces your brand's aesthetic.
