// KISS keep it simple stupid

// let customer choose what date range works best for them first, then time of day, that being morning, noon, or evening(assuming they work that late in the day)

// after customer has chosen what works best for them, they will then put their name, email, number, location, and a short message if they want.

// also they will be given the option to choose what time is best to contact them. morning, noon, or evening. This is not required. 

// rememeber that old people will be the majority of the clients, so this needs can't be to confusing.
