🛠️ Technical Implementation
Component-Based Architecture

Scalability: Engineered a modular, component-based architecture using React JSX to ensure the codebase is easy to maintain and expand as the business grows. 

Consistency: Each component (Navbar, Hero, Service Cards) is paired with its own CSS file, keeping logic and styles encapsulated.

Global Styling: All design tokens, including the "Poolside" color palette and typography, are managed via CSS variables in the :root selector for instant site-wide updates.

Performance & Deployment

Frontend: Built with Vite and React for optimized load times and a smooth Single Page Application (SPA) feel. 


Hosting: Deployed via Vercel to ensure high availability and fast performance for local customers. 


Backend: Integrated with Firebase to handle backend requirements and data management. 

✅ Live Features
Responsive Navigation: A mobile-first Navbar with custom animations and a functional hamburger menu for easy browsing on any device.

Service Discovery: Clear, intuitive layout of company services designed to drive customer engagement.

Production Stability: A fully functional, bug-free environment currently serving real-world traffic at betterstatepools.com.

🎨 Design System (index.css)
The site utilizes a curated color palette defined in the global CSS:

--usa-dark: Midnight Green (Primary Brand)

--usa-blue: Oceanic Blue (Water/Pool Theme)

--sky-blue: Celeste (Accent/Highlights)

--usa-white: Snow White (Clean Backgrounds)

--usa-red: Subtle Coral Red (Calls to Action)
