# Better State LLC Web App

A modern, responsive website for Better State LLC. Built with React and React Router, this project is currently focused on navigation, structure, and component planning.

## 🧱 Project Overview

This is the beginning of a React-based website for Better State LLC. The goal is to deliver a clean, accessible UI with a subtle USA + swimming pool-inspired color theme.

## 📁 File & Folder Structure

- `src/components/`
  - Contains all reusable UI components (Navbar, HamburgerBtn, etc.)
  - Each component is documented with inline notes for clarity and future development
- `src/pages/`
  - Placeholder for route-based page components (e.g. Home, About Us, Contact)
- `src/App.jsx`
  - Sets up routes and renders persistent layout components (e.g. Navbar)

## ✅ Features So Far

- Responsive `Navbar` with working hamburger menu
- Navigation links using React Router (`react-router-dom`)
- Mobile-friendly toggle menu with animation and styling
- Color theme uses CSS variables with a "subtle USA / poolside" aesthetic
- Clean file structure prepared for scalable development

## 🎨 Color Scheme

The design uses custom CSS variables defined in `index.css`:

- `--usa-dark`: Midnight Green
- `--usa-white`: Snow White
- `--usa-blue`: Oceanic Blue
- `--usa-red`: Subtle Coral Red
- `--sky-blue`: Celeste Accent

## 📌 Notes for Developers

- All components include inline comments for understanding and extension
- Mobile-first design with flexbox and media queries in `Navbar`
- Hamburger button is animated with toggle state via `useState`

## 🛠️ Coming Soon

- Route pages: Home, About Us images, Contact, What We Do, Book Online
- Single page application
- Scroll animations and section-based layout
- Backend integration with Firebase and Vercel Deployment
